To build dhrystone just type 'make' and the result "arm_dhrystone_*" will be produced.
To clean run 'make clean'
To run just execute 'run.sh'

I don't know how to set 'HZ'. It is supposed to be frequncy the CPU clock
runs at. It was set to 100 for A0 so I kept it through B0. 

The results are in the 'results' directory.
